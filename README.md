**If you are running a local version, anything before version 2.5.3 is not supported. Don't even ask.**

## Why use NavalBot?

NavalBot is the best multi purpose bot available.  

It currently supports:

 - Custom factoids
 - Music playing, even in multiple servers
 - Moderation abilities
 - Other fun commands
 
Unlike many other bots, it's also fast due to the asyncio-based back end.

## Download and Installation

1. Download the latest release from [the releases page] (https://github.com/sundwarf/navalbot/releases/latest)  
2. Put the files (unzipped if you downloaded the .zip) in a new folder on your computer.  
3. Open up `__init__.py` and change `RCE_IDS` to match your Discord user id.  

Next, open your command line and launch `bot.py` with the login credentials for your bot.  
E.g: `>>  python bot.py --oauth-bot-id <client-id> --oauth-bot-secret <oauth token>`

## Configuration

Make sure to create a `Bot Commander` role and assign it to your Discord moderators/admins.  
Members with the `Bot Commander` role can execute specifc commands that are inaccessible for regular members.  
Your bot needs the `Admin` flag in order for moderation commands like `?kick` or `?ban` to work. 

### Creating the `Muted` Role

This role is needed for the `?mute` and `?unmute` command to work.

1. Create a role named 'Muted'
2. Go into your server settings and edit the permissions for the role

    - Make sure that only these three options are enabled
3. Go into the channel specific permissions and make sure that none of the `@everyone` permissions are checked

4. Add the `Muted` role and remove these permissions

    - Repeat this step for every channel in which you want the `Muted` role to work
    
### Configuring the music commands

You need a Google Youtube API v3 key in order for commands like `searchyt` and `playyt` to work properly.

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Register a new application which uses the Google Youtube v3 API
3. Copy your key
4. Add it to the server configuration with `?setcfg "youtube_api_key" "your_key"`
   **IMPORTANT:** Make sure that nobody sees your API key!
5. [Download ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20160412-git-196cfc2-win64-static.7z) and add ffmpeg.exe to your $PATH

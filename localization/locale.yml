# This is the localization database for NavalBot.
# This is used to localize messages.
#
# locale.yml is the default file, where keys are loaded from if they do not exist
# locale.<lang>.yml is used for loading locale from language-specific files.
#
# When localizing a file, DO NOT REPLACE ANYTHING INSIDE { } OR ANYTHING INSIDE :_:.
# These are used by the bot to build up the strings automatically.
# You can re-order them for the sentences to make sense, but they must stay in the sentence.
